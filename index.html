<p>
  The main aim of the Data For Climate Action Edinburgh (D4CAE) group is to help other climate volunteers around Edinburgh, using our data skills.
</p>
<p>
  We have a <a href="https://github.com/Data-4-Climate-Action-Edinburgh/Data4ClimateActionEdinburgh_Code_etc">GitHub repository</a> 
    that we use to make a large proportion of our data, our code and so on publicly available, under an open licence. 
</p>

If you would like help with climate or biodiversity data, 
  please get in touch -
